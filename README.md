1.	Introduction:


Course Management System is a system that uses GUI to make efficient interaction between students and instructors in college for record-keeping, submission of assignments, creation of courses and for making accounts of students and instructors.

2.	Scope:


It enables the college or university to provide an individual user account to each student. All the user accounts (instructors and students) are password protected. So, the records can be termed as secured. In Course Management System, the only administrative section is allowed to create the account, but students and instructors can register with the system.
